This repo is the resulting source code of the [Getting Started Ash Authentication Phoenix](https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix/blob/main/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-ash-authentication-phoenix.md) tutorial. It is meant to be a starting point for training purposes.

After cloning this repo, you can run the following commands to get started (they setup the database and start the Phoenix server):

```bash
$ mix ash_postgres.create
$ mix ash_postgres.migrate
$ mix phx.server
```
